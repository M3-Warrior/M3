"¹ Obtained from https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/downloads/file/24587/open_space_assessment_2022, the ""Environmental Score""  is a summary statistic that takes into account access to greenspace, if the location is a heat island or prone to floods, and environmental health factors. A lower score is better, a higher score is worse. Raw data on land use and open space can also be found in the same report. The Environmental Score has been averaged across all Wards in a constituency. ",,,,,,,,,,,
